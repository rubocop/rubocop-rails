Using `flash` assignment before `render` in Rails controllers will persist the message for too long.
Check https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#flash-now

[#safety-railsactioncontrollerflashbeforerender]

This cop's autocorrection is unsafe because it replaces `flash` by `flash.now`.
Even though it is usually a mistake, it might be used intentionally.

Using `ActionController::TestCase` is discouraged and should be replaced by
`ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest`. Controller tests are too close to the
internals of a controller whereas integration tests mimic the browser/user.

[#safety-railsactioncontrollertestcase]

Prevents usage of `"*"` on an Arel::Table column reference.

Using `arel_table["\*"]` causes the outputted string to be a literal
quoted asterisk (e.g. `my_model`.`*`). This causes the
database to look for a column named `\*` (or `"*"`) as opposed
to expanding the column list as one would likely expect.

[#safety-railsarelstar]
=== Safety

This cop's autocorrection is unsafe because it turns a quoted `\*` into
an SQL `*`, unquoted. `\*` is a valid column name in certain databases
supported by Rails, and even though it is usually a mistake,
it might denote legitimate access to a column named `*`.

Looks for belongs_to associations where we control whether the
association is required via the deprecated `required` option instead.

Since Rails 5, belongs_to associations are required by default and this
can be controlled through the use of `optional: true`.

From the release notes:

    belongs_to will now trigger a validation error by default if the
    association is not present. You can turn this off on a
    per-association basis with optional: true. Also deprecate required
    option in favor of optional for belongs_to. (Pull Request)

In the case that the developer is doing `required: false`, we
definitely want to autocorrect to `optional: true`.

However, without knowing whether they've set overridden the default
value of `config.active_record.belongs_to_required_by_default`, we
can't say whether it's safe to remove `required: true` or whether we
should replace it with `optional: false` (or, similarly, remove a
superfluous `optional: false`). Therefore, in the cases we're using
`required: true`, we'll simply invert it to `optional: false` and the
user can remove depending on their defaults.

Checks for code that can be written with simpler conditionals
using `Object#blank?` defined by Active Support.

Interaction with `Style/UnlessElse`:
The configuration of `NotPresent` will not produce an offense in the
context of `unless else` if `Style/UnlessElse` is enabled. This is
to prevent interference between the autocorrection of the two cops.

[#safety-railsblank]

This cop is unsafe autocorrection, because `' '.empty?` returns false,

Checks whether alter queries are combinable.
If combinable queries are detected, it suggests to you
to use `change_table` with `bulk: true` instead.
This option causes the migration to generate a single
ALTER TABLE statement combining multiple column alterations.

The `bulk` option is only supported on the MySQL and
the PostgreSQL (5.2 later) adapter; thus it will
automatically detect an adapter from `development` environment
in `config/database.yml` or the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`
when the `Database` option is not set.
If the adapter is not `mysql2`, `trilogy`, `postgresql`, or `postgis`,
this Cop ignores offenses.

Checks if collection can be blank-compacted with `compact_blank`.

[#safety-railscompactblank]
=== Safety

It is unsafe by default because false positives may occur in the
blank check of block arguments to the receiver object.

For example, `[[1, 2], [3, nil]].reject { |first, second| second.blank? }` and
`[[1, 2], [3, nil]].compact_blank` are not compatible. The same is true for `blank?`.
This will work fine when the receiver is a hash object.

And `compact_blank!` has different implementations for `Array`, `Hash`, and
`ActionController::Parameters`.
`Array#compact_blank!`, `Hash#compact_blank!` are equivalent to `delete_if(&:blank?)`.
If the cop makes a mistake, autocorrected code may get unexpected behavior.

Checks the migration for which timestamps are not included when creating a new table.
In many cases, timestamps are useful information and should be added.

NOTE: Allow `timestamps` not written when `id: false` because this emphasizes respecting

Checks for the correct use of Date methods,
such as Date.today, Date.current etc.

Using `Date.today` is dangerous, because it doesn't know anything about
Rails time zone. You must use `Time.zone.today` instead.

The cop also reports warnings when you are using `to_time` method,
because it doesn't know about Rails time zone either.

Two styles are supported for this cop. When `EnforcedStyle` is `strict`
then the Date methods `today`, `current`, `yesterday`, and `tomorrow`
are prohibited and the usage of both `to_time`
and `to_time_in_current_zone` are reported as warning.

When `EnforcedStyle` is `flexible` then only `Date.today` is prohibited.

And you can set a warning for `to_time` with `AllowToTime: false`.
`AllowToTime` is `true` by default to prevent false positive on `DateTime` object.

Looks for delegations that could have been created
automatically with the `delegate` method.

Safe navigation `&.` is ignored because Rails' `allow_nil`
option checks not just for nil but also delegates if nil
responds to the delegated method.

The `EnforceForPrefixed` option (defaulted to `true`) means that
using the target object as a prefix of the method name
without using the `delegate` method will be a violation.
When set to `false`, this case is legal.

It is disabled for controllers in order to keep controller actions
explicitly defined.

Checks that blocks are used for interpolated strings passed to

By default, Rails production environments use the `:info` log level.
At the `:info` log level, `Rails.logger.debug` statements do not result
in log output. However, Ruby must eagerly evaluate interpolated string
arguments passed as method arguments. Passing a block to
`Rails.logger.debug` prevents costly evaluation of interpolated strings
when no output would be produced anyway.

Enforces that `exit` calls are not used within a rails app.
Valid options are instead to raise an error, break, return, or some
other form of stopping execution of current request.

There are two obvious cases where `exit` is particularly harmful:

* Usage in library code for your application. Even though Rails will
rescue from a `SystemExit` and continue on, unit testing that library
code will result in specs exiting (potentially silently if `exit(0)`
is used.)
* Usage in application code outside of the web process could result in
the program exiting, which could result in the code failing to run and
do its job.

by primary key when you expect it to be found.

[#safety-railsfindeach]

This cop is unsafe if the receiver object is not an Active Record object.
Also, `all.each` returns an `Array` instance and `all.find_each` returns nil,
so the return values are different.

Identifies usages of `travel_to` with an argument of the current time and
change them to use `freeze_time` instead.

This cop’s autocorrection is unsafe because `freeze_time` just delegates to
`travel_to` with a default `Time.now`, it is not strictly equivalent to `Time.now`
if the argument of `travel_to` is the current time considering time zone.

Checks for use of the helper methods which reference

Relying on instance variables makes it difficult to reuse helper
methods.

If it seems awkward to explicitly pass in each dependent
variable, consider moving the behavior elsewhere, for

an offense will not be registered.

Looks for has_(one|many) and belongs_to associations where
Active Record can't automatically determine the inverse association
because of a scope or the options used. Using the blog with order scope
example below, traversing the a Blog's association in both directions
with `blog.posts.first.blog` would cause the `blog` to be loaded from
the database twice.

`:inverse_of` must be manually specified for Active Record to use the
associated object in memory, or set to `false` to opt-out. Note that
setting `nil` does not stop Active Record from trying to determine the
inverse automatically, and is not considered a valid value for this.

You can technically specify methods of superclass or methods added by
mixins on the filter, but these can confuse developers. If you specify
methods that are defined in other classes or modules, you should
define the filter in that class or module.

`target: '_blank'` but no `rel: 'noopener'`. This can be a security
risk as the loaded page will have control over the previous page
and could change its location for phishing purposes.

The option `rel: 'noreferrer'` also blocks this behavior
and removes the http-referrer header.

Checks for add_column calls with a NOT NULL constraint without a default
value.

This cop only applies when adding a column to an existing table, since
existing records will not have a value for the new column. New tables
can freely use NOT NULL columns without defaults, since there are no
records that could violate the constraint.

If you need to add a NOT NULL column to an existing table, you must add
it as nullable first, back-fill the data, and then use
`change_column_null`. Alternatively, you could add the column with a
default first to have the database automatically backfill existing rows,
and then use `change_column_default` to remove the default.

`TEXT` cannot have a default value in MySQL.
The cop will automatically detect an adapter from `development`
environment in `config/database.yml` or the environment variable
`DATABASE_URL` when the `Database` option is not set. If the database
is MySQL, this cop ignores offenses for `TEXT` columns.

Enforces the use of `pick` over `pluck(...).first`.

Using `pluck` followed by `first` creates an intermediate array, which
`pick` avoids. When called on an Active Record relation, `pick` adds a
limit to the query so that only one value is fetched from the database.

Note that when `pick` is added to a relation with an existing limit, it
causes a subquery to be added. In most cases this is undesirable, and
care should be taken while resolving this violation.

[#safety-railspick]

This cop is unsafe because `pluck` is defined on both `ActiveRecord::Relation` and `Enumerable`,
whereas `pick` is only defined on `ActiveRecord::Relation` in Rails 6.0. This was addressed

Enforces the use of `pluck` over `map`.

`pluck` can be used instead of `map` to extract a single key from each
element in an enumerable. When called on an Active Record relation, it
results in a more efficient query that only selects the necessary key.

NOTE: If the receiver's relation is not loaded and `pluck` is used inside an iteration,
it may result in N+1 queries because `pluck` queries the database on each iteration.
This cop ignores offenses for `map/collect` when they are suspected to be part of an iteration

| 2.7

|===

Identifies places where `pluck` is used in `where` query methods
and can be replaced with `select`.

Since `pluck` is an eager method and hits the database immediately,
using `select` helps to avoid additional database queries by running as
a subquery.

This cop has two modes of enforcement. When the `EnforcedStyle` is set
to `conservative` (the default), only calls to `pluck` on a constant
(e.g. a model class) within `where` are considered offenses.

[#safety-railspluckinwhere]
=== Safety

When `EnforcedStyle` is set to `aggressive`, all calls to `pluck`
within `where` are considered offenses. This might lead to false
positives because the check cannot distinguish between calls to
`pluck` on an `ActiveRecord::Relation` instance and calls to `pluck`
on an `Array` instance.

Additionally, when using a subquery with the SQL `IN` operator,
databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL can't optimize complex queries as
well. They need to scan all records of the outer table against the
subquery result sequentially, rather than using an index. This can
cause significant performance issues compared to writing the query
differently or using `pluck`.

If an attribute is missing from the instance (for example, when

Explicitly raising an error in this situation is preferable, and that

Since Rails 5.0 the default for `belongs_to` is `optional: false`
unless `config.active_record.belongs_to_required_by_default` is
explicitly set to `false`. The presence validator is added
automatically, and explicit presence validation is redundant.

Identifies possible cases where Active Record save! or related
should be used instead of save because the model might have failed to
save and an exception is better than unhandled failure.

This will allow:

* update or save calls, assigned to a variable,
  or used as a condition in an if/unless/case statement.
* create calls, assigned to a variable that then has a
  call to `persisted?`, or whose return value is checked by
  `persisted?` immediately
* calls if the result is explicitly returned from methods and blocks,
  or provided as arguments.
* calls whose signature doesn't look like an ActiveRecord
  persistence method.

By default it will also allow implicit returns from methods and blocks.
that behavior can be turned off with `AllowImplicitReturn: false`.

You can permit receivers that are giving false positives with
`AllowedReceivers: []`

Checks for the use of exit statements (namely `return`,
`break` and `throw`) in transactions. This is due to the eventual
unexpected behavior when using ActiveRecord >= 7, where transactions
exited using these statements are being rollbacked rather than
committed (pre ActiveRecord 7 behavior).

As alternatives, it would be more intuitive to explicitly raise an
error when rollback is desired, and to use `next` when commit is
desired.

If you are defining custom transaction methods, you can configure it with `TransactionMethods`.

NOTE: This cop is disabled on Rails >= 7.2 because transactions were restored
to their historical behavior. In Rails 7.1, the behavior is controlled with

Prefer using `distinct` before `pluck` instead of `uniq` after `pluck`.

The use of distinct before pluck is preferred because it executes by
the database.

This cop has two different enforcement modes. When the EnforcedStyle
is `conservative` (the default), then only calls to `pluck` on a constant
(i.e. a model class) before `uniq` are added as offenses.

When the EnforcedStyle is `aggressive` then all calls to `pluck` before
distinct are added as offenses. This may lead to false positives
as the cop cannot distinguish between calls to `pluck` on an
ActiveRecord::Relation vs a call to pluck on an
ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy.

When you define a uniqueness validation in Active Record model,
you also should add a unique index for the column. There are two reasons.
First, duplicated records may occur even if Active Record's validation
is defined.
Second, it will cause slow queries. The validation executes a `SELECT`
statement with the target column when inserting/updating a record.
If the column does not have an index and the table is large,
the query will be heavy.

Note that the cop does nothing if db/schema.rb does not exist.

Suggests you remove a column that does not exist in the schema from `ignored_columns`.
`ignored_columns` is necessary to drop a column from RDBMS, but you don't need it after the migration
to drop the column. You avoid forgetting to remove `ignored_columns` by this cop.

IMPORTANT: This cop can't be used to effectively check for unused columns because the development
and production schema can be out of sync until the migration has been run on production. As such,
this cop can cause `ignored_columns` to be removed even though the production schema still contains
the column, which can lead to downtime when the migration is actually executed. Only enable this cop
if you know your migrations will be run before any of your Rails applications boot with the modified code.

Enforces consistent style when using `exists?`.

Two styles are supported for this cop. When EnforcedStyle is 'exists'
then the cop enforces `exists?(...)` over `where(...).exists?`.

When EnforcedStyle is 'where' then the cop enforces
`where(...).exists?` over `exists?(...)`.

[#safety-railswhereexists]
=== Safety

This cop is unsafe for autocorrection because the behavior may change on the following case:

[source,ruby]
----
Author.includes(:articles).where(articles: {id: id}).exists?
#=> Perform `eager_load` behavior (`LEFT JOIN` query) and get result.

Author.includes(:articles).exists?(articles: {id: id})
#=> Perform `preload` behavior and `ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid` error occurs.

Identifies calls to `where.not` with multiple hash arguments.

The behavior of `where.not` changed in Rails 6.1. Prior to the change,
`.where.not(trashed: true, role: 'admin')` evaluated to
`WHERE trashed != TRUE AND role != 'admin'`.
From Rails 6.1 onwards, this executes the query
`WHERE NOT (trashed == TRUE AND roles == 'admin')`.

[#examples-railswherenotwithmultipleconditions]
=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
User.where.not(trashed: true, role: 'admin')
User.where.not(trashed: true, role: ['moderator', 'admin'])
User.joins(:posts).where.not(posts: { trashed: true, title: 'Rails' })

# good
User.where.not(trashed: true)
User.where.not(role: ['moderator', 'admin'])
User.where.not(trashed: true).where.not(role: ['moderator', 'admin'])
User.where.not('trashed = ? OR role = ?', true, 'admin')

Identifies places where manually constructed SQL
in `where` can be replaced with ranges.

[#safety-railswhererange]
=== Safety

This cop's autocorrection is unsafe because it can change the query
by explicitly attaching the column to the wrong table.
For example, `Booking.joins(:events).where('end_at < ?', Time.current)` will correctly
implicitly attach the `end_at` column to the `events` table. But when autocorrected to
`Booking.joins(:events).where(end_at: ...Time.current)`, it will now be incorrectly
explicitly attached to the `bookings` table.
