|===

Using `flash` assignment before `render` in Rails controllers will persist the message for too long.
Check https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#flash-now

=== Safety

This cop's autocorrection is unsafe because it replaces `flash` by `flash.now`.
Even though it is usually a mistake, it might be used intentionally.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
class HomeController < ApplicationController
  def create
    flash[:alert] = "msg"
    render :index
  end
end

# good
class HomeController < ApplicationController
  def create
    flash.now[:alert] = "msg"
    render :index
  end

|===

Using `ActionController::TestCase` is discouraged and should be replaced by
`ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest`. Controller tests are too close to the
internals of a controller whereas integration tests mimic the browser/user.

=== Safety

This cop's autocorrection is unsafe because the API of each test case class is different.
Make sure to update each test of your controller test cases after changing the superclass.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
class MyControllerTest < ActionController::TestCase
end

# good
class MyControllerTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest

|===

Enforces the consistent use of action filter methods.

The cop is configurable and can enforce the use of the older
something_filter methods or the newer something_action methods.

IMPORTANT: This cop is deprecated. Because the `*_filter` methods were removed in Rails 4.2,
and that Rails version is no longer supported by RuboCop Rails. This cop will be removed in RuboCop Rails 3.0.

=== Examples

Enforces consistent ordering of the standard Rails RESTful controller actions.

The cop is configurable and can enforce any ordering of the standard actions.
All other methods are ignored. So, the actions specified in `ExpectedOrder` should be
defined before actions not specified.

|===

Checks that ActiveRecord aliases are not used. The direct method names
are more clear and easier to read.

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe because custom `update_attributes` method call was changed to
`update` but the method name remained same in the method definition.

=== Examples

| Yes (Unsafe)
| 2.16
| -
|===

Checks for Rails framework classes that are patched directly instead of using Active Support load hooks. Direct
patching forcibly loads the framework referenced, using hooks defers loading until it's actually needed.

=== Safety

While using lazy load hooks is recommended, it changes the order in which is code is loaded and may reveal
load order dependency bugs.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
ActiveRecord::Base.include(MyClass)

# good
ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_record) { include MyClass }

Checks for migrations using `add_column` that have an `index`
key. `add_column` does not accept `index`, but also does not raise an
error for extra keys, so it is possible to mistakenly add the key without
realizing it will not actually add an index.

=== Examples

Enforces that there is only one call to `after_commit`
(and its aliases - `after_create_commit`, `after_update_commit`,
and `after_destroy_commit`) with the same callback name per model.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad

| Enabled
| Yes
| Yes (Unsafe)
| 2.9
| -
|===

Prevents usage of `"*"` on an Arel::Table column reference.

Using `arel_table["*"]` causes the outputted string to be a literal
quoted asterisk (e.g. <tt>`my_model`.`*`</tt>). This causes the
database to look for a column named <tt>`*`</tt> (or `"*"`) as opposed
to expanding the column list as one would likely expect.

=== Safety

This cop's autocorrection is unsafe because it turns a quoted `*` into
an SQL `*`, unquoted. `*` is a valid column name in certain databases
supported by Rails, and even though it is usually a mistake,
it might denote legitimate access to a column named `*`.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
MyTable.arel_table["*"]

MyTable.arel_table[Arel.star]

Looks for belongs_to associations where we control whether the
association is required via the deprecated `required` option instead.

Since Rails 5, belongs_to associations are required by default and this
can be controlled through the use of `optional: true`.

From the release notes:

    belongs_to will now trigger a validation error by default if the
    association is not present. You can turn this off on a
    per-association basis with optional: true. Also deprecate required
    option in favor of optional for belongs_to. (Pull Request)

In the case that the developer is doing `required: false`, we
definitely want to autocorrect to `optional: true`.

However, without knowing whether they've set overridden the default
value of `config.active_record.belongs_to_required_by_default`, we
can't say whether it's safe to remove `required: true` or whether we
should replace it with `optional: false` (or, similarly, remove a
superfluous `optional: false`). Therefore, in the cases we're using
`required: true`, we'll simply invert it to `optional: false` and the
user can remove depending on their defaults.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :blog, required: false
end

# good
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :blog, optional: true
end

# bad
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :blog, required: true
end

# good
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :blog, optional: false

| Enabled
| Yes
| Yes (Unsafe)
| 0.48
| 2.10
|===

Checks for code that can be written with simpler conditionals
using `Object#blank?` defined by Active Support.

Interaction with `Style/UnlessElse`:
The configuration of `NotPresent` will not produce an offense in the
context of `unless else` if `Style/UnlessElse` is enabled. This is
to prevent interference between the autocorrection of the two cops.

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe autocorrection, because `' '.empty?` returns false,
but `' '.blank?` returns true. Therefore, autocorrection is not compatible
if the receiver is a non-empty blank string, tab, or newline meta characters.

=== Examples

==== NilOrEmpty: true (default)

[source,ruby]
----
# Converts usages of `nil? || empty?` to `blank?`

# bad
foo.nil? || foo.empty?
foo == nil || foo.empty?

== Rails/BulkChangeTable

| Enabled by default | Safe | Supports autocorrection | Version Added | Version Changed

| Enabled

| 0.57
| 2.20
|===

Checks whether alter queries are combinable.
If combinable queries are detected, it suggests to you
to use `change_table` with `bulk: true` instead.
This option causes the migration to generate a single
ALTER TABLE statement combining multiple column alterations.

The `bulk` option is only supported on the MySQL and
the PostgreSQL (5.2 later) adapter; thus it will
automatically detect an adapter from `development` environment
in `config/database.yml` or the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`
when the `Database` option is not set.
If the adapter is not `mysql2`, `trilogy`, `postgresql`, or `postgis`,
this Cop ignores offenses.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
def change
  add_column :users, :name, :string, null: false
  add_column :users, :nickname, :string

  # ALTER TABLE `users` ADD `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL

== Rails/CompactBlank

| Pending
| No
| Yes (Unsafe)
| 2.13
| -
|===

Checks if collection can be blank-compacted with `compact_blank`.

=== Safety

It is unsafe by default because false positives may occur in the
blank check of block arguments to the receiver object.

For example, `[[1, 2], [3, nil]].reject { |first, second| second.blank? }` and
`[[1, 2], [3, nil]].compact_blank` are not compatible. The same is true for `blank?`.
This will work fine when the receiver is a hash object.

And `compact_blank!` has different implementations for `Array`, `Hash`, and
`ActionController::Parameters`.
`Array#compact_blank!`, `Hash#compact_blank!` are equivalent to `delete_if(&:blank?)`.
`ActionController::Parameters#compact_blank!` is equivalent to `reject!(&:blank?)`.
If the cop makes a mistake, autocorrected code may get unexpected behavior.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
collection.reject(&:blank?)
collection.reject { |_k, v| v.blank? }

# good
collection.compact_blank

# bad
collection.delete_if(&:blank?)            # Same behavior as `Array#compact_blank!` and `Hash#compact_blank!`
collection.delete_if { |_k, v| v.blank? } # Same behavior as `Array#compact_blank!` and `Hash#compact_blank!`
collection.reject!(&:blank?)              # Same behavior as `ActionController::Parameters#compact_blank!`

Checks for the correct use of Date methods,
such as Date.today, Date.current etc.

Using `Date.today` is dangerous, because it doesn't know anything about
Rails time zone. You must use `Time.zone.today` instead.

The cop also reports warnings when you are using `to_time` method,
because it doesn't know about Rails time zone either.

Two styles are supported for this cop. When `EnforcedStyle` is 'strict'
then the Date methods `today`, `current`, `yesterday`, and `tomorrow`
are prohibited and the usage of both `to_time`
and 'to_time_in_current_zone' are reported as warning.

When `EnforcedStyle` is `flexible` then only `Date.today` is prohibited.

And you can set a warning for `to_time` with `AllowToTime: false`.
`AllowToTime` is `true` by default to prevent false positive on `DateTime` object.

=== Safety

This cop's autocorrection is unsafe because it may change handling time.

=== Examples

==== EnforcedStyle: flexible (default)

|===

Looks for delegations that could have been created
automatically with the `delegate` method.

Safe navigation `&.` is ignored because Rails' `allow_nil`
option checks not just for nil but also delegates if nil
responds to the delegated method.

The `EnforceForPrefixed` option (defaulted to `true`) means that
using the target object as a prefix of the method name
without using the `delegate` method will be a violation.
When set to `false`, this case is legal.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
def bar
  foo.bar
end

# good
delegate :bar, to: :foo

# bad
def bar
  self.bar
end

# good

Checks that blocks are used for interpolated strings passed to
`Rails.logger.debug`.

By default, Rails production environments use the `:info` log level.
At the `:info` log level, `Rails.logger.debug` statements do not result
in log output. However, Ruby must eagerly evaluate interpolated string
arguments passed as method arguments. Passing a block to
`Rails.logger.debug` prevents costly evaluation of interpolated strings
when no output would be produced anyway.

=== Examples

Enforces that `exit` calls are not used within a rails app.
Valid options are instead to raise an error, break, return, or some
other form of stopping execution of current request.

There are two obvious cases where `exit` is particularly harmful:

* Usage in library code for your application. Even though Rails will
rescue from a `SystemExit` and continue on, unit testing that library
code will result in specs exiting (potentially silently if `exit(0)`
is used.)
* Usage in application code outside of the web process could result in
the program exiting, which could result in the code failing to run and
do its job.

Checks for places where I18n "lazy" lookup can be used.

This cop has two different enforcement modes. When the EnforcedStyle
is `lazy` (the default), explicit lookups are added as offenses.

When the EnforcedStyle is `explicit` then lazy lookups are added as
offenses.

=== Examples

Checks for the use of `I18n.locale=` method.

The `locale` attribute persists for the rest of the Ruby runtime, potentially causing
unexpected behavior at a later time.
Using `I18n.with_locale` ensures the code passed in the block is the only place `I18n.locale` is affected.
It eliminates the possibility of a `locale` sticking around longer than intended.

Looks for assignments of `ignored_columns` that may override previous
assignments.

Overwriting previous assignments is usually a mistake, since it will
un-ignore the first set of columns. Since duplicate column names is not
a problem, it is better to simply append to the list.

=== Examples

|===

Looks for has_(one|many) and belongs_to associations where
Active Record can't automatically determine the inverse association
because of a scope or the options used. Using the blog with order scope
example below, traversing the a Blog's association in both directions
with `blog.posts.first.blog` would cause the `blog` to be loaded from
the database twice.

`:inverse_of` must be manually specified for Active Record to use the
associated object in memory, or set to `false` to opt-out. Note that
setting `nil` does not stop Active Record from trying to determine the
inverse automatically, and is not considered a valid value for this.

Checks that methods specified in the filter's `only` or
`except` options are defined within the same class or module.

=== Safety

You can technically specify methods of superclass or methods added by
mixins on the filter, but these can confuse developers. If you specify
methods that are defined in other classes or modules, you should
define the filter in that class or module.

If you rely on behavior defined in the superclass actions, you must
remember to invoke `super` in the subclass actions.

Checks for calls to `link_to` that contain a

risk as the loaded page will have control over the previous page

The option `rel: 'noreferrer'` also blocks this behavior
and removes the http-referrer header.

Enforces the use of `pick` over `pluck(...).first`.

Using `pluck` followed by `first` creates an intermediate array, which
`pick` avoids. When called on an Active Record relation, `pick` adds a
limit to the query so that only one value is fetched from the database.

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe because `pluck` is defined on both `ActiveRecord::Relation` and `Enumerable`,
whereas `pick` is only defined on `ActiveRecord::Relation` in Rails 6.0. This was addressed
in Rails 6.1 via rails/rails#38760, at which point the cop is safe.

`pluck` can be used instead of `map` to extract a single key from each
element in an enumerable. When called on an Active Record relation, it
results in a more efficient query that only selects the necessary key.

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe because model can use column aliases.

[source,ruby]
----
# Original code
User.select('name AS nickname').map { |user| user[:nickname] } # => array of nicknames

# After autocorrection
User.select('name AS nickname').pluck(:nickname) # => raises ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid
----

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
Post.published.map { |post| post[:title] }
[{ a: :b, c: :d }].collect { |el| el[:a] }

# good
Post.published.pluck(:title)
[{ a: :b, c: :d }].pluck(:a)

|===

Identifies places where `pluck` is used in `where` query methods
and can be replaced with `select`.

Since `pluck` is an eager method and hits the database immediately,
using `select` helps to avoid additional database queries.

This cop has two different enforcement modes. When the `EnforcedStyle`
is `conservative` (the default) then only calls to `pluck` on a constant
(i.e. a model class) in the `where` is used as offenses.

=== Safety

When the `EnforcedStyle` is `aggressive` then all calls to `pluck` in the
`where` is used as offenses. This may lead to false positives
as the cop cannot replace to `select` between calls to `pluck` on an
`ActiveRecord::Relation` instance vs a call to `pluck` on an `Array` instance.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
Post.where(user_id: User.active.pluck(:id))
Post.where(user_id: User.active.ids)
Post.where.not(user_id: User.active.pluck(:id))

# good
Post.where(user_id: User.active.select(:id))
Post.where(user_id: active_users.select(:id))

Interaction with `Style/UnlessElse`:
The configuration of `NotBlank` will not produce an offense in the
context of `unless else` if `Style/UnlessElse` is enabled. This is
to prevent interference between the autocorrection of the two cops.

=== Examples

|===

Checks for Rake tasks without the `:environment` task
dependency. The `:environment` task loads application code for other
Rake tasks. Without it, tasks cannot make use of application code like
models.

You can ignore the offense if the task satisfies at least one of the
following conditions:

* The task does not need application code.
* The task invokes the `:environment` task.

=== Safety

Probably not a problem in most cases, but it is possible that calling `:environment` task
will break a behavior. It's also slower. E.g. some task that only needs one gem to be
loaded to run will run significantly faster without loading the whole application.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
task :foo do
  do_something
end

# good
task foo: :environment do
  do_something

|===

Checks for the use of the `read_attribute` or `write_attribute`
methods and recommends square brackets instead.

If an attribute is missing from the instance (for example, when
initialized by a partial `select`) then `read_attribute`
will return nil, but square brackets will raise
an `ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError`.

Explicitly raising an error in this situation is preferable, and that
is why rubocop recommends using square brackets.

When called from within a method with the same name as the attribute,
`read_attribute` and `write_attribute` must be used to prevent an
infinite loop:

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
x = read_attribute(:attr)
write_attribute(:attr, val)

# good
x = self[:attr]
self[:attr] = val

|===

Detect redundant `all` used as a receiver for Active Record query methods.

For the methods `delete_all` and `destroy_all`, this cop will only check cases where the receiver is a model.
It will ignore cases where the receiver is an association (e.g., `user.articles.all.delete_all`).
This is because omitting `all` from an association changes the methods
from `ActiveRecord::Relation` to `ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy`,
which can affect their behavior.

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe for autocorrection if the receiver for `all` is not an Active Record object.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
User.all.find(id)
User.all.order(:created_at)
users.all.where(id: ids)
user.articles.all.order(:created_at)

Since Rails 5.0 the default for `belongs_to` is `optional: false`
unless `config.active_record.belongs_to_required_by_default` is
explicitly set to `false`. The presence validator is added
automatically, and explicit presence validation is redundant.

=== Safety

This cop's autocorrection is unsafe because it changes the default error message
from "can't be blank" to "must exist".

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----

Checks for the usage of `require_dependency`.

`require_dependency` is an obsolete method for Rails applications running in Zeitwerk mode.
In Zeitwerk mode, the semantics should match Ruby's and no need to be defensive with load order,

Use `Rails.root` IO methods instead of passing it to `File`.

`Rails.root` is an instance of `Pathname`
so we can apply many IO methods directly.

This cop works best when used together with
`Style/FileRead`, `Style/FileWrite` and `Rails/RootJoinChain`.

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe for autocorrection because ``Dir``'s `children`, `each_child`, `entries`, and `glob`
methods return string element, but these methods of `Pathname` return `Pathname` element.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
File.open(Rails.root.join('db', 'schema.rb'))
File.open(Rails.root.join('db', 'schema.rb'), 'w')
File.read(Rails.root.join('db', 'schema.rb'))

Checks to make sure safe navigation isn't used with `blank?` in
a conditional.

=== Safety

While the safe navigation operator is generally a good idea, when
checking `foo&.blank?` in a conditional, `foo` being `nil` will actually
do the opposite of what the author intends.

For example:

[source,ruby]
----
foo&.blank? #=> nil
foo.blank? #=> true
----

=== Examples

[source,ruby]

# bad
do_something if foo&.blank?
do_something unless foo&.blank?

|===

Identifies possible cases where Active Record save! or related
should be used instead of save because the model might have failed to
save and an exception is better than unhandled failure.

This will allow:

* update or save calls, assigned to a variable,
  or used as a condition in an if/unless/case statement.
* create calls, assigned to a variable that then has a
  call to `persisted?`, or whose return value is checked by
  `persisted?` immediately
* calls if the result is explicitly returned from methods and blocks,
  or provided as arguments.
* calls whose signature doesn't look like an ActiveRecord
  persistence method.

By default it will also allow implicit returns from methods and blocks.
that behavior can be turned off with `AllowImplicitReturn: false`.

You can permit receivers that are giving false positives with
`AllowedReceivers: []`

=== Safety

This cop's autocorrection is unsafe because a custom `update` method call would be changed to `update!`,
but the method name in the definition would be unchanged.

There also should be some performance improvement since it skips instantiating the model class for matches.

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe because the model might override the attribute getter.
Additionally, the model's `after_initialize` hooks are skipped when using `pluck`.

Checks for the use of Time methods without zone.

Built on top of Ruby on Rails style guide (https://rails.rubystyle.guide#time)
and the article http://danilenko.org/2012/7/6/rails_timezones/

Two styles are supported for this cop. When `EnforcedStyle` is 'strict'
then only use of `Time.zone` is allowed.

When EnforcedStyle is 'flexible' then it's also allowed
to use `Time#in_time_zone`.

=== Safety

This cop's autocorrection is unsafe because it may change handling time.

Checks for the use of exit statements (namely `return`,
`break` and `throw`) in transactions. This is due to the eventual
unexpected behavior when using ActiveRecord >= 7, where transactions
exited using these statements are being rollbacked rather than
committed (pre ActiveRecord 7 behavior).

As alternatives, it would be more intuitive to explicitly raise an
error when rollback is desired, and to use `next` when commit is
desired.

If you are defining custom transaction methods, you can configure it with `TransactionMethods`.

|===

Prefer using `distinct` before `pluck` instead of `uniq` after `pluck`.

The use of distinct before pluck is preferred because it executes by
the database.

This cop has two different enforcement modes. When the EnforcedStyle
is `conservative` (the default), then only calls to `pluck` on a constant
(i.e. a model class) before `uniq` are added as offenses.

When the EnforcedStyle is `aggressive` then all calls to `pluck` before
distinct are added as offenses. This may lead to false positives
as the cop cannot distinguish between calls to `pluck` on an
ActiveRecord::Relation vs a call to pluck on an
ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy.

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe for autocorrection because the behavior may change
depending on the database collation.

=== Examples

==== EnforcedStyle: conservative (default)

[source,ruby]
----
# bad - redundantly fetches duplicate values
Album.pluck(:band_name).uniq

|===

When you define a uniqueness validation in Active Record model,
you also should add a unique index for the column. There are two reasons.
First, duplicated records may occur even if Active Record's validation
is defined.
Second, it will cause slow queries. The validation executes a `SELECT`
statement with the target column when inserting/updating a record.
If the column does not have an index and the table is large,
the query will be heavy.

Note that the cop does nothing if db/schema.rb does not exist.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad - if the schema does not have a unique index
validates :account, uniqueness: true

# good - if the schema has a unique index
validates :account, uniqueness: true

# good - even if the schema does not have a unique index

Suggests you remove a column that does not exist in the schema from `ignored_columns`.
`ignored_columns` is necessary to drop a column from RDBMS, but you don't need it after the migration
to drop the column. You avoid forgetting to remove `ignored_columns` by this cop.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
class User < ApplicationRecord
  self.ignored_columns = [:already_removed_column]
end

# good
class User < ApplicationRecord
  self.ignored_columns = [:still_existing_column]
end

If you try to render content along with a non-content status code (100-199, 204, 205, or 304),
it will be dropped from the response.

This cop checks for uses of `render` which specify both body content and a non-content status.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
render 'foo', status: :continue
render status: 100, plain: 'Ruby!'

# good
head :continue
head 100

Identifies places where manually constructed SQL
in `where` can be replaced with `where(attribute: value)`.

=== Safety

This cop's autocorrection is unsafe because is may change SQL.
See: https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-rails/issues/403

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
User.where('name = ?', 'Gabe')
User.where('name = :name', name: 'Gabe')
User.where('name IS NULL')
User.where('name IN (?)', ['john', 'jane'])
User.where('name IN (:names)', names: ['john', 'jane'])
User.where('users.name = :name', name: 'Gabe')

# good
User.where(name: 'Gabe')
User.where(name: nil)
User.where(name: ['john', 'jane'])
User.where(users: { name: 'Gabe' })

|===

Enforces consistent style when using `exists?`.

Two styles are supported for this cop. When EnforcedStyle is 'exists'
then the cop enforces `exists?(...)` over `where(...).exists?`.

When EnforcedStyle is 'where' then the cop enforces
`where(...).exists?` over `exists?(...)`.

=== Safety

This cop is unsafe for autocorrection because the behavior may change on the following case:

[source,ruby]
----
Author.includes(:articles).where(articles: {id: id}).exists?
#=> Perform `eager_load` behavior (`LEFT JOIN` query) and get result.

Author.includes(:articles).exists?(articles: {id: id})
#=> Perform `preload` behavior and `ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid` error occurs.
----

=== Examples

==== EnforcedStyle: exists (default)

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
User.where(name: 'john').exists?
User.where(['name = ?', 'john']).exists?
User.where('name = ?', 'john').exists?
user.posts.where(published: true).exists?

# good
User.exists?(name: 'john')
User.where('length(name) > 10').exists?
user.posts.exists?(published: true)
----

==== EnforcedStyle: where

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
User.exists?(name: 'john')
User.exists?(['name = ?', 'john'])
user.posts.exists?(published: true)

# good
User.where(name: 'john').exists?
User.where(['name = ?', 'john']).exists?
User.where('name = ?', 'john').exists?
user.posts.where(published: true).exists?
User.where('length(name) > 10').exists?

|===

Identifies calls to `where.not` with multiple hash arguments.

The behavior of `where.not` changed in Rails 6.1. Prior to the change,
`.where.not(trashed: true, role: 'admin')` evaluated to
`WHERE trashed != TRUE AND role != 'admin'`.
From Rails 6.1 onwards, this executes the query
`WHERE NOT (trashed == TRUE AND roles == 'admin')`.

=== Examples

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
User.where.not(trashed: true, role: 'admin')
User.where.not(trashed: true, role: ['moderator', 'admin'])
User.joins(:posts).where.not(posts: { trashed: true, title: 'Rails' })

# good
User.where.not(trashed: true)
User.where.not(role: ['moderator', 'admin'])
User.where.not(trashed: true).where.not(role: ['moderator', 'admin'])
User.where.not('trashed = ? OR role = ?', true, 'admin')
